# Stock-Analysis

## Overview 
#### Steve would like us to analyze the stocks data using VBA. The stocks market dataset contains two years data for 2017 and 2018. We will compare how well each stock did. 

## Purpose
#### The purpose of the project was to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018. And to access and compare the execution times of the original script and refractored script.

## Results 
#### The analysis done for stock performances for two years were similar as shown in module 2. Based on the analysis in year 2017 except ticker, TERP; the rest stocks showed positive returns whereas in 2018 only two stocks (ENPH and RUN) showed positive returns. Therefore, year 2017 stocks had higher positive returs as compared to 2018.The excution time for refactored Vs original script shows that the refactored scripts were much quicker that the original scripts.

## Summary
### Advantages
-removes excess or redundant codes while refractoring so it's easier to understand and modify the codes

-Writing codes are quicker and executing faster

-Improves codes quality and the design of existing code, and can help with debugging

-Use to fix bugs, clean, and organize codes.

-Refractoring is always an option
### Disadvantages
-can break working code that is difficult to understand and poorly structured

-It may introduce bugs and risky in the view of management

-The process requires skills and discipline
